# LowPassFilterForSpeechEnhancement
This project investigates the application of low pass filters
for speech enhancement. The main focus is on assessing how
low pass filtering can improve speech quality by reducing
high-frequency noise while preserving important speech components.
The study utilizes the Noizeus dataset, comprising
50,000 samples of varied speech recordings, as the primary
data source. The best results were achieved with a particular
combination of filter parameters, which significantly enhanced
speech quality. Expected outcomes include assessing how well
different low pass filter designs improve speech clarity and
understanding. The project aims to provide practical recommendations
for implementing low pass filters in real-world
speech enhancement systems.
Here,we are using three techniques for speech Enhancement:
a).Low Pass Filter
b).Spectral Subtraction
c).Frequency Domain Filtering

The graph indicates the final significant redution in noise in the filtered out wave.
